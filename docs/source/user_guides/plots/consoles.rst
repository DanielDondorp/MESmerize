Consoles
********

Currently the :ref:`Heatmap <plot_Heatmap>`, :ref:`Scatter <plot_Scatter>`, :ref:`Proportions plot <plot_Proportions>` and :ref:`KShape <plot_KShape>` follow a uniform structure allowing internal access to the data and plot axes. Refer to their :ref:`Base API <API_PlotBases>`. For example, through their consoles you can access the :ref:`Transmission <concept_Transmission>` containing data for the current plot, manually save the plot, etc.
