Batch Manager
*************

**Batch process computationally intensive tasks.**

.. seealso:: :ref:`Batch Manager API <API_BatchManager>`

This is currently used for :ref:`Caiman Motion Correction <module_CaimanMotionCorrection>`, :ref:`CNMF <module_CNMF>`, and :ref:`CNMFE <module_CNMFE>`.

The Batch Manager can be accessed in the viewer through Modules -> Batch Manager. If you don't have a batch open you will be prompted with a dialog to open a batch or to select a location for a new batch.

.. warning:: The full path to the batch directory must not contain spaces or special characters, only a-z, A-Z, 0-9 and underscores.

The Batch Manager processes the batch items in external processes, allowing you to add batch items when that batch is being processed.
