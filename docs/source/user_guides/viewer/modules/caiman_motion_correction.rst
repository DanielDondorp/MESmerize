.. _module_CaimanMotionCorrection:

Caiman Motion Correction
************************

Perform motion correction using the NoRMCorre implementation in the CaImAn library.

**I highly recommend going through the following before using this module**

    - NoRMCorre paper
        `Pnevmatikakis, E. A., & Giovannucci, A. (2017). NoRMCorre: An online algorithm for piecewise rigid motion correction of calcium imaging data. Journal of Neuroscience Methods, 291, 83â€“94. <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jneumeth.2017.07.031>`_

    - The CaImAn demo notebook, the implementation in Mesmerize is basically from the demo
        https://github.com/flatironinstitute/CaImAn/blob/master/demos/notebooks/demo_motion_correction.ipynb

.. image:: ./caiman_motion_correction.png

**Parameters**

Output bit depth: The motion corrected image sequences are of float32 type. You can optionally convert the output to 8 or 16 bit uint types to save disk space. **This doesn't always work from my experience, values might get clipped**.

For all other parameters please see the demo notebook mentioned above.

Usage
=====

This module adds a "caiman motion correction" *item* to the batch. Set the desired parameters (see demo notebook) and then enter a name to add it as an *item* to the batch. After the batch item is processed, double-click the batch item to open the motion corrected image sequence in the viewer. You can then use this motion corrected image sequence for further analysis, such as :ref:`CNMF <module_CNMF>` or :ref:`CNMFE <module_CNMFE>`.

.. seealso:: This modules uses the :ref:`Batch Manager <module_BatchManager>`.

.. note:: The parameters used for motion correction are stored in the work environment of the viewer and this log is carried over and saved in the :ref:`Project Sample <ProjectSample>` as well. To see the parameters that were used for motion correction in the viewer, execute ``get_workEnv().history_trace`` in the viewer console and look for the ``caiman_motion_correction`` entry.

Script Usage
============

A script can be used to add caiman motion correction batch items. This is much faster than using the GUI.

.. seealso:: :ref:`Script Editor <module_ScriptEditor>`

Add items
---------

This example shows how to add all tiff files (of image sequences) from a directory as batch items with 3 different variants of parameters.

.. seealso:: This example uses the :ref:`Caiman Motion Correction Module API <API_CaimanMotionCorrection>`, :ref:`ViewerWorkEnv API <API_ViewerWorkEnv>`, and :ref:`Batch Manager API <API_BatchManager>`

Crop and add items
------------------

This example shows how to crop videos prior to adding them as batch items. This is useful if you want to crop-out large unchanging regions of your movides. It uses either simple thresholding or spectral salieny on a standard deviation projection to determine the bounding box for cropping.

.. seealso:: This example uses the :ref:`Caiman Motion Correction Module API <API_CaimanMotionCorrection>`, :ref:`ViewerWorkEnv API <API_ViewerWorkEnv>`, and :ref:`Batch Manager API <API_BatchManager>`
